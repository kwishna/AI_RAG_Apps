Corrective RAG (CRAG)
-----------------------
CRAG is a method that enhances the accuracy of LLMs by intelligently re-incorporating information from retrieved documents.
It uses an evaluator to assess the quality of documents obtained for a query and decides whether to use, ignore, or request more data from these documents.
CRAG extends its information beyond static databases by using web searches, ensuring access to a wider, up-to-date range of information.
It also employs a unique strategy to break down and rebuild retrieved documents, focusing on getting the most relevant information while eliminating distractions

Self-RAG
----------
Self-RAG, on the other hand, is a fine-tuned model that incorporates mechanisms for adaptive information retrieval and self-critique.
It can dynamically determine when external information is needed and critically evaluates its generated responses for relevance and factual accuracy.
Self-RAG uses reflection and critique tokens to enable the model to make informed decisions about whether to retrieve additional information and to assess the quality of its responses and
the relevance of any retrieved information.

The main differences between CRAG and Self-RAG are:

Approach: CRAG focuses on correcting the information retrieval process by evaluating the quality of documents and deciding how to use them,
whereas Self-RAG focuses on self-critique and adaptive information retrieval, enabling the model to dynamically determine when external information is needed and to evaluate its own responses.

Functionality: CRAG is designed to improve the accuracy of LLMs by re-incorporating information from retrieved documents,
whereas Self-RAG is designed to enhance the model's ability to generate contextually relevant and factually accurate responses by incorporating mechanisms for self-critique and adaptive information retrieval.

Training process: CRAG does not involve a specific training process,
whereas Self-RAG involves a fine-tuning process that adds reflection and critique tokens to the dataset, training the model to understand when and how to critique the generation's relevance and factual alignment

Corrective RAG (CRAG):

Step 1: Retrieval Evaluator
Employ a lightweight retrieval evaluator to assess the overall quality of retrieved documents for a query, returning a confidence score for each document.

Step 2: Web-Based Document Retrieval
Perform web-based document retrieval to supplement context if vector store retrieval is deemed ambiguous or irrelevant to the user.

Step 3: Knowledge Refinement
Perform knowledge refinement of retrieved documents by partitioning them into "knowledge strips", grading each strip, and filtering out irrelevant ones.

Step 4: Generation
Use the refined documents to generate an answer grounded in the retrieved documents.
